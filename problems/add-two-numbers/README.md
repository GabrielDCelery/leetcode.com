# The problem

[Add two numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

# Notes

Built it with a recursive algorithm and match operator.

If I get a chance would like to investigate if

A. there is a better solution than match
B. Could I use references instead of passing ownership to recursive function
