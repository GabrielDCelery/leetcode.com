# The problem

[Palindrome number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

# Notes

The trick to solving the problem is realizing that base 10 logarithm can be used to figure out the digit count.

After that we introduct a loop to create a new number that is the reverse of that number by using remainders and power of 10 operators.
